[8:14]
Plyhi:
	do you think its posiible to make a mod which can unequipped all spells from a new found wand without replace a wand in your inventory by it
	I really been annoyed by replace and repick a lot when i first play the game

[14:17]
CristoElMago:
	same as fusion but not fusion?
	but you only need a always tinker perk, or a mod that let you tinker wands everywhere
	that already exists

[14:21]
Plyhi:
	but I still need to pick up new,unequip spells from it and then pick up old one

[14:25]
CristoElMago:
	if you drop the spells to the ground, you have to pickup anyways
	shift+click will send a spell from wand to inventory, and viceversa

[15:29]
CristoElMago:
	idea: change the shape of the noita character to a random wand at game start
	mod name "Noita is a wand"

[15:29]
Plyhi:
	hhhh

[15:29]
CristoElMago:
	could be hylarious, a wand jumping around, carrying a wand XD
	do you like it?
	maybe change the shape when pickup a wand?

[15:36]
Plyhi:
	sounds funny
	you change right into what you hold
	i know ways to get the file same with your wand
	have seen the function before
	its interesting and easy to achieve
	thought not a mod for me ususally  to subscribe it i think
	I think we can do it
	what else idea do you hav

[15:43]
CristoElMago:
	you have time now to a brainstorming?

[15:44]
Plyhi:
	yes

[15:44]
CristoElMago:
	so it's turn of a mod idea ;)
	your turn*
	say whatever

[15:45]
Plyhi:
	we can make a wand shape flybroomstick
	when you hold you have infinite fly energy
	and get boosted when cilick left =

[15:46]
CristoElMago:
	oh a flying bloom that sounds nice

[15:46]
Plyhi:
	put it in a random but finite position in map for runner to pfind
	maybe one of 3 designed position
	when you get it you can fly all the way left of this run

[15:49]
CristoElMago:
	we could just change the character sprite, make it have infinite levitation and high speed. that seems too shabby. in example the RPG mod already give you more speed and levitation the more level up
	another idea a way to control world weather. spells to make it rain, snow, foggy, change day/night

[15:50]
Plyhi:
	already one mod doing this
	but i think the point of broomstick idea is to use the broom like harry potter
	to actually let your character hold it like that way in movie
	weather good idea
	the weather mod already exists does many strange rain like lava slime poison or sth else
	and theres a time sync mod to make the world time sync to real time through your computer system
	what about a fishing mod
	set a boat on lake west of the world
	you can ride on it and take out a rod in that hut for fishing
	and maybe set a fish store somewhere in the world so you can use fish to roll for rewards

[15:58]
CristoElMago:
	mmm that sound okay
	a floating boat, but the fishes should have to be spawned
	do you think on a fishing minigame of press button at time?

[15:59]
Plyhi:
	you dont have to have actual fish entities i think
	yes like stardew valley one
	no need to be to complex
	o about the weather
	I think of something
	a Projectile Correction that can Adapt spell effects based on daytime, nighttime, or other weather conditions
	for example add damage and ignite if its daytime,add tracking effect and froze if its night

[16:04]
CristoElMago:
	you know something I miss about Noita is no building
	you can just spawn a wall or floor using magic
	somewhat as minecraft
	but pixel level

[16:04]
Plyhi:
	I knoe
	I seems to have seen one similar
	but to spawn not build a structure

[16:05]
CristoElMago:
	maybe make the trees able to drop wood

[16:05]
Plyhi:
	hhh

[16:05]
CristoElMago:
	then you could make wood planks

[16:06]
Plyhi:
	dude you are actually do a terraria from start in Noita

[16:06]
CristoElMago:
	I've not played terraria but I watch one or two videos

[16:06]
Plyhi:
	yeah

[16:06]
CristoElMago:
	similar to noita but not so similar

[16:07]
Plyhi:
	i dont like terraria for its apperance
	fade out compare with Noita though similar tytpe

[16:07]
CristoElMago:
	another idea. the world is very narrow, it's long up and down, but left-right is small. maybe a mod that widen the world

[16:08]
Plyhi:
	its suuper big work
	you know this game works by plate splicing
	that means you need to write and debug for splicing logic
	and also design many new plate as the origin game did

[16:10]
CristoElMago:
	we can just move the paralell world separators and put something there, or enlarge current biomes
	but this is a brainstorm, more ideas! :P

[16:11]
Plyhi:
	alright
	a new structure that allows you to store sth for future runs to take out of from
	idea from slay the spire

[16:13]
CristoElMago:
	slay the spire doesn't have a place to store things xD

[16:13]
Plyhi:
	there is bro
	a question mark room
	that allows you to save a card for future run

[16:14]
CristoElMago:
	oh but it's very rare, aint it?

[16:14]
Plyhi:
	but you wont meet it when you play at your highest level of each character
	or else not very rare

[16:15]
CristoElMago:
	well as a noita mod is good idea
	a permanent place, or someway to summon the box and pick what's inside

[16:16]
Plyhi:
	yead
	oh
	i have another crazy idea
	a random event : you may meet an npc at a holy moutain who let you to take something without being harmed over xx  value(or the thing be borken
	or else maybe a time limit
	or something else
	when you make it to next holy moutain
	th npc
	show up again to give you reward

[16:20]
CristoElMago:
	have you played "fair mod"?

[16:20]
Plyhi:
	not yet
	hav something similar?

[16:20]
CristoElMago:
	there's an npc at holy mountains
	somewhat similar
	as is an "annoying" mod the npc does random things, not sure if gives missions, maybe

[16:21]
Plyhi:
	I really dont know what the fair mod did
	ohh
	maybe hit you or something

[16:22]
CristoElMago:
	but it would be nice an npc that let you choose among several missions, one time-based, one "pick all wands on next floor" or "visit the neighbour biome on next floor"

[16:22]
Plyhi:
	or steal one thing from shop(and can be witnessed by you )and lost something else when he left

[16:22]
CristoElMago:
	the fair mod npc has dialogue but I think is more of jokes or similar

[16:23]
Plyhi:
	imagine when you get to the next shop you seeing someone sneaking and steal
	hh

[16:24]
CristoElMago:
	yea a guy that you have to talk to, then he steal something and runs, you have to kill it on the next floor, or he will stay on next mountain to do the same
	something like a run maybe
	you have to be faster than the guy to get to next holy

[16:24]
Plyhi:
	really interesting random event

[16:25]
CristoElMago:
	I think really hard to develop, but that's not for a brainstorm xDD

[16:25]
Plyhi:
	soo for npc why dont we have a elder tutor

[16:26]
CristoElMago:
	talking about the holy mountain, you can make peace with gods so they don't spawn the skeleton. a new perk with "become a god" to transform into the skeleton

[16:26]
Plyhi:
	who may show up and cast strong spells to save us when we nealy death by damage from a boss
	he shows up and kill the boss, and cast a big shield to include both of us init and talk to us
	then vanished through a teleport magic after dialog

[16:27]
CristoElMago:
	oh yes, the game lacks of a tutorial... we could place a house with a guy inside, similar to the house of the ocean, that you can open a portal and go see the grand master
	he kill the boss? like a god-like ally? protection from god perk

[16:28]
Plyhi:
	grand master will leave you a random but very thoughtful wand mindfully build (based on a list by modder)
	so player shall learn from it everytime they fullfilled masters mission
	perk yes

[16:29]
CristoElMago:
	when you would die he instantly put a shield on you, heal to max, make a massive explosion (assuring you're protected with the shield) and maybe kill everything around, or heavy damage

[16:29]
Plyhi:
	maybe a perk that let the grand show up to protect you (by gorgous way) for next x
	times when you near death
	i want to see a huuuuge rune pattern from the master in the air

[16:30]
CristoElMago:
	xD

[16:30]
Plyhi:
	that shall be heartmoving

[16:31]
CristoElMago:
	alright that sounds fine
	more ideas!
	if any? XDD
	about the music boxes. they only serve the key mission, to open a lame chest...

[16:32]
Plyhi:
	you want to do meme music by them >
	qwq
	alright many easter egg to put in
	when you pour different potion to it
	it gives certain music
	all for players to find out

[16:33]
CristoElMago:
	oh a crazy idea: Super Mario Bros realma portal takes you to somewhere else, where the first level of super mario for nes is. we only have to create the enemies of woomba

[16:34]
Plyhi:
	thats cute

[16:34]
CristoElMago:
	ooh nice! pour liquids on a music box will make them sound different songs. somewhat curious mod but it's fine
	oh but for the mario mod, we should make if the woomba top touches the player, then they die and the player fly up

[16:35]
Plyhi:
	do you think we can do clothes system
	we now have a slot for armour(

[16:35]
CristoElMago:
	also the ? boxes, we neeed to make the hitbox detect the player top to make somethng spawn
	a slot for armour??

[16:36]
Plyhi:
	and each have diff resistance for diff damage type
	to get different quality of outfit in the world

[16:36]
CristoElMago:
	what you mean "we have now slot armor" there's no slot in the game, or is it

[16:37]
Plyhi:
	i mean mod can does this
	not now

[16:37]
CristoElMago:
	oh yes we can

[16:37]
Plyhi:
	yeah

[16:37]
CristoElMago:
	ah kk gotcha

[16:37]
Plyhi:
	collect good looking and useful outfit

[16:37]
CristoElMago:
	we make make an UI for every type of armor slot, like arms, legs, rings

[16:37]
Plyhi:
	thats part of rpg too
	no
	not that much type
	or spell and other things shall have less possibility to spawn

[16:38]
CristoElMago:
	yes, the armor could be spawned killing a mob, instead of gold. or make the player create a workshop to craft it

[16:38]
Plyhi:
	i think 2 types is ok
	robe and ring
	enemy dropmake sense

[16:38]
CristoElMago:
	yeah both make sense
	we could make it have a random chance to drop and a workshop to build

[16:39]
Plyhi:
	you can have mana  charge or always cast with ring
	and get defend by robe
	for example a rare robe with fire immune

[16:40]
CristoElMago:
	all that is covered by perks... we could remove all the perks and make instead a full RPG armor system, with a crafting table and add materials to the game
	isn't that terraria? XD

[16:40]
Plyhi:
	hh
	but more attractive
	hey
	i want to say
	after playing with mods so many time

[16:41]
CristoElMago:
	terraria just does all that noita doesn't, and viceversa :P

[16:41]
Plyhi:
	i found the game itself just did balanced
	any mod i enable would make the game either way far too easy or far too hard
	like making powerful wand too easilu
	y
	i think i enjoy being a witch more than a adventureer

[16:42]
CristoElMago:
	aha
	continue
	I agree
	but what's the point?

[16:44]
Plyhi:
	hey do you think we can Hatching and nurturing  a creature
	by collecting a unique egg
	from the holy tree

[16:44]
CristoElMago:
	problem is it would die easy
	or make a pen to hold it

[16:45]
Plyhi:
	we can make a special hatching place over ground
	or the same npc show up at next moutain to tell you where to hatch it

[16:46]
CristoElMago:
	maybe a dragon, and can mount it, similar to the broom idea

[16:46]
Plyhi:
	griffin i suggest
	once he grew up game shall comes to an end when character leave the world forewver((((

[16:47]
CristoElMago:
	yeah whatever, maybe more. I was thinking to an old dragon, something like the dragon ball shenlong, like a snake with wings

[16:48]
Plyhi:
	https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/15211355726301257643/F063F9971469D4E836F4DE38BB97B320208C1FD4/

[16:48]
CristoElMago:
	leave the world by jumping onto the dragon/griffin?
	yeah similar to that

[16:48]
Plyhi:
	but that needs a crazy amount of art resource

[16:48]
CristoElMago:
	remember those are made with pixels

[16:48]
Plyhi:
	to fully achieve the cool scene we imagine
	an anime means per frame

[16:49]
CristoElMago:
	noita has tools to make it with code, no need a sprite
	anime means per frame? what is that mean?

[16:50]
Plyhi:
	you need to draw sprite per frame for a whole action
	never mind,lets go on to the next
	one smaller idear
	you know all bosses in Noita just came out suddenly out of screen

[16:51]
CristoElMago:
	oh to make a cut scene for endgame? like an anime video for 1 minute

[16:51]
Plyhi:
	and only a health bar tells you thats a boss

[16:51]
CristoElMago:
	yeah

[16:51]
Plyhi:
	I think Noitia doesnt leave a end game interface for modders
	so we can make all bosses have a button to summon
	when you summon the plateform shows a fancy rune
	and play a sound effect

[16:53]
CristoElMago:
	well maybe not a button as-is, but a box you destroy to make the boss spawn is very feasible

[16:53]
Plyhi:
	something like that

[16:53]
CristoElMago:
	good one

[16:53]
Plyhi:
	In short, it's a sense of ceremony where we're ready to take on the challenge

[16:54]
CristoElMago:
	oh yes that would make it too. a unique way to summon the bosses, with pour certain liquids or powder materials, maybe use certain spell near the liquid-material mix

[16:55]
Plyhi:
	what do you thinik we can do around a percentage of the war fog that we have cleared count from a biome chunk

[16:55]
CristoElMago:
	we could spawn a cauldron on the boss/orb room

[16:56]
Plyhi:
	a percantage of Exploratory

[16:56]
CristoElMago:
	oh something when a % exploration done? like in dead cells, we could make the whole biome no fog war when 70% of the fog war is cleared

[16:56]
Plyhi:
	that shall be a part of mission by master
	ohhh
	thats good
	but could we actually reach that high in Noita
	usually Noita world not that easy to clear

[16:58]
CristoElMago:
	you mean noita overworld?
	I say for the current biome
	but there's a perk that does it

[16:59]
Plyhi:
	yes
	for example coalpit

[16:59]
CristoElMago:
	I mean that's no use if you have the all seeing perk

[16:59]
Plyhi:
	when you get 80% of coal pit master show up in next holy mountain and help you create a back path to coal pit
	(there you can make this run a long route run
	how about a demon trade
	idea from issac
	where you can use your max hp to exchange for stronger reward in demon reward pool
	but once you deal,you cant go bcak
	you are one of demon
	so somthing in world will change
	but if you  choose to activate and kill the demon in holy mountain

[17:03]
CristoElMago:
	can't go back? that's not noita-ish

[17:04]
Plyhi:
	not phisicaly cant go back
	i mean, you cant wash your sin no more
	(((
	but if you choose to kill demon ,an angel deal will show up

[17:05]
CristoElMago:
	what's the angel deal

[17:05]
Plyhi:
	in issac it is items from angel pool
	i think in noita  we can do more defending perks or spells
	you can get more defending ability through angel
	after all you already could kill demon

[17:06]
CristoElMago:
	that seems good for the npc mod
	we can gather several of this ideas

[17:06]
Plyhi:
	and set in one

[17:07]
CristoElMago:
	the npc shows up in holy mountain. there are several options. a race, a mission, a shop

[17:07]
Plyhi:
	Id like to see some different event on deeper levels'
	for example npc could be killed by something else in some case
	ooo
	do you remember there are random case for each floor
	i mean sometimes plants grow in the biome
	sometimes there are many fungus

[17:09]
CristoElMago:
	yes

[17:09]
Plyhi:
	npc event can be based on this
	if theres many water,the npc could be wet and need you to give him fire magic to dry

[17:11]
CristoElMago:
	there's several variables on each world seed, for every biome and much more. we can choose on those to base the npc random behaviour. yes

[17:11]
Plyhi:
	a good idea
	do you think we can give him stable to get hint on secrete

[17:12]
CristoElMago:
	hint on secret?
	we can gather more of the ideas. the npc tutorial house, it could be the same

[17:13]
Plyhi:
	ok
	ahh
	one interesting thing
	if we drop him a wand
	he would fire it once
	and give the wand back to us
	and deal comment
	(
	YOUR WAND IS LEGEND DUDE

[17:15]
CristoElMago:
	lol
	hey dude I'm trying to watch back on our conversation, the chat seem to have a limit

[17:15]
Plyhi:
	alrigjt
	i think im done today  i fetch cold and start coughing just now

[17:16]
CristoElMago:
	our ideas are being erased WTF

[17:16]
Plyhi:
	i have kept it

[17:16]
CristoElMago:
	take your blanket!
	the idea of dropping a wand and have the npc shoot it, is veeeery dangerous xD but yeah would be good wink make the npc say something about it

[17:17]
Plyhi:
	uh

[17:20]
CristoElMago:
	are you okay? take a soup or something dude :P
	there were many ideas
	more than enough to start a new mod for npc

[17:24]
Plyhi:
	Im saving our logs

[17:24]
CristoElMago:
	right :)I found a way to access all

[17:25]
Plyhi:
	check your github
	i have summarize them
	gn for today dude
	its enjoyable of  brainstroming

[17:26]
CristoElMago:
	good night, rest well, and get good
	yeah very funny, and it worked we have a bunch of good ideas to implement
	lets watch what's going out from this :)
